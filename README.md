# COEN178-Labs
Lab assignments completed for Introduction to Database Systems (COEN 178)
Note: several of these lab assignments were to modify existing 
code. That code is credited to both Professor Rani Mikkilineni and very helpful TA Mosekola Yoyole :)

The earlier labs covered topics on Relational Data Models and SQL queries. Then, from Lab 4ish onward, we learned about PLSQL and how to
write functions, triggers, and if-else statements using it. We expanded our back-end knowledge and modified code that dealt with webpages 
(Lab 7) and HTML. Our final lab assignment was a collaboration with another student that implemented a Rental Management System using 
everything we learned this quarter. If you're interested, please take a look at https://github.com/Lleeshen/RentalManagementSystem
