Answers to Questions 

Exercise 1
Did your trigger work? 
Yes and I modified it to display the city upon insertion as well 

Exercise 2
Did your trigger work? How did you check?
The trigger did not work at first because the rows I was trying to insert were
violating integrity constraints. This was because while I was inserting values
into Bankcust_6 previously, the first row with custno 'c1' didn't get added for
some reason. After I added that to the referenced table for Accounts_6, the 
trigger could successfully activate when I inserted the correct row. 

Now the trigger worked. I checked by looking at the what is displayed in the
Totals_6 table, which contains:
CUSTN TOTALAMOUNT
----- -----------
c2           9000
c33           500
c1           7000
c20           150

'c1' has the amount 7000,and agrees with the amounts in the Accounts_6 table


Exercise 3
What is the amount for the customer, ‘c1’? 
It is 7000.

Does the amount in Totals_6 table for ‘c1’ agree with the total of amounts in all the accounts for ‘c1’ in Accounts_6 table?

No, because as shown in Accounts_6:
ACCOU ACCOUNTTYP     AMOUNT CUSTN
----- ---------- ---------- -----
a4378 checking	       1000 c2
a5363 saving	       8000 c2
a7236 checking		500 c33
a1523 checking	       1000 c1
a2134 saving	       5000 c1
a8577 checking		150 c20

c1 should display 6000 in Totals_6, but it doesn't.

Exercise 4
The amount for customer 'c1' is 6000 and agrees with the total amounts from
the Accounts_6 table.

Exercise 5
The trigger did not allow me to update the primary key because it was written 
to do so.
